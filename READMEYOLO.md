# Waste-Classification
A waste classification model for classifying images/videos into categories like glass, paper, metal, cardboard etc.  The purpose of this model is to implement deep learning and object detection techniques for classification. By leveraging these to technologies the aim is to build a enhanced model.

# ♻️ Waste Classification using YOLOv8

This project implements a deep learning-based object detection model using YOLOv8 to classify various types of waste (plastic, metal, paper, etc.) in images and videos. The model is designed to help improve waste sorting and recycling through real-time detection using a web-based interface built with Streamlit.
